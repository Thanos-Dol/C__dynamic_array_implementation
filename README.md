# C__dynamic_array_implementation
A library that will implement a generic dynamically allocated (array size changes with respect to the number of elements stored inside so it always has space for the elements) fixed sized array in C. The main goal is to be able to use it as part of other applications, so it must be implemented in a generic way.
